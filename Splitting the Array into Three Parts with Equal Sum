Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, the goal is to determine if it can be split into three contiguous non-empty parts such that the sum of each part is the same. If such a split is possible, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Example:
Input:

css
Copy code
arr = [1, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 1]
Output:

arduino
Copy code
true
Explanation:

The array can be split into three parts: [1, 2, 3], [0], and [3, 2, 1]. The sum of each part is 6.

Constraints:
The length of the array is at least 3.
Each element in the array is an integer (positive, negative, or zero).
