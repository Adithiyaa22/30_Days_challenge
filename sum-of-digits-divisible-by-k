PROBLEM 
The program must accept two integers N and K as input. The program must print the count of integers from 1 to N having the sum of digits divisible by K.

Boundary Conditions : 

1≤N≤100000

1≤K≤100
  
Input Format
  
The first line contains two integers N and K separated by a space.
Output Format
The first line contains an integer representing the count of integers from 1 to N having the sum of digits divisible by K.

  
Example Input/Output
  
Input:
30 4

Output:
6

Explanation:
There are 6 integers from 1 to 30 having the sum of digits divisible by 4:  
4, 8, 13, 17, 22, 26  
So, 6 is printed as the output

CODE:

#include <stdio.h>


int sum_of_digits(int num) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        sum += num % 10;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    int N, K;
    int count = 0;

    
    scanf("%d %d", &N, &K);

    
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (sum_of_digits(i) % K == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    
    printf("%d\n", count);

    return 0;
}
